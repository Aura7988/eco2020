# Acknowledgments

> Jun 11th 2020

Many people contributed to this Technology Quarterly, and not all of them are quoted. The author would particularly like to thank Rodney Brooks, Euan Cameron, Fabrice Ciais, Mary "Missy" Cummings, Andrew Feldman, Tracy Frey, James Gralton, Alex Harvey, Xuedong Huang, Christopher Manning, Gary Marcus, Alfonso Marone, Jerome Pesenti, Ron Schmelzer, Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Svetlana Sicular, Krysta Svore, Nigel Toon and Adrian Waller. Several other interviewees preferred that their names not be used. Their contributions were equally valuable.
